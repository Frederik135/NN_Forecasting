/opt/anaconda3/envs/masterarbeit/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:441: The 'val_dataloader' does not have many workers which may be a bottleneck. Consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument` to `num_workers=9` in the `DataLoader` to improve performance.
